            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to the workshop on <strong>AI for Fully-Automated Chip Design</strong>, to be located with ISCA 2024.
                Over the past decades, numerous researchers and engineers have made significant contributions
                to the design of high-performance computers. The pursuit of <strong>automated processor design</strong> has been
                a long-standing goal. As artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrates its potential to outperform
                humans in specific areas — such as playing Go, optimizing code, and predicting protein
                structures — architecture researchers are increasingly interested in exploring the use of AI
                techniques to enable automated processor design. Some recent advancements in this field have
                made some progress in AI-based architecture optimization. However, these initiatives lag
                significantly behind the goal of achieving autonomous processor design and self-evolution,
                a concept envisioned by Von Neumann in 1956 as "Self-Reproducing Automata". Clearly, processor
                design is fundamentally different from traditional AI tasks: The precision necessary for CPU
                design is extraordinarily high (>99.99999999999%), vastly surpassing the levels typically
                associated with prediction and generation tasks in the field of AI. CPU design is the ultimate
                product of logical computation, an area in which current data-driven AI technologies fall short,
                presenting a formidable challenge to the proficiency of modern AI.
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore, we aim to organize this workshop to bring together more architectural designers to
                discuss how to <strong>apply AI techniques to boost automated architectural design</strong>, and <strong>where are the
                boundaries of AI techniques in automated design</strong>.

It touches everything that chip designers care about, from power/performance/area (PPA) to cost/yield, turn-around-time, security, and so on. It is everywhere, in all levels of design abstractions, testing, verification, DTCO, mask synthesis / ILT, and some aspects of analog/mixed-signal and RF IC designs as well. It has also been used to tweak the overall design flow and hyper-parameter tuning, but not yet all at once, e.g., generative AI from design specification to layout, in a correct-by-construction manner. In this talk, I will cover some recent advancement/breakthroughs in AI for automated chip design and share my perspectives.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Abstract</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Physical design stands as a pivotal step in the intricate design flow of contemporary VLSI circuits. It maps a circuit design into a physical layout with manufacturable gates and wires. Modern physical design necessitates numerous iterations across multiple design stages to achieve convergence in performance, power, and area. This iterative process is often exceedingly time-intensive. However, amidst the current wave of artificial intelligence, deep learning has emerged as a transformative force, demonstrating remarkable potential across diverse domains such as computer vision, recommendation systems, and robotics. Integrating deep learning into the VLSI design workflow has thus gained significant attention as a promising avenue. In this presentation, we delve into our recent endeavors in developing efficient cross-stage models grounded on open-source datasets like CircuitNet, and examine how these models can facilitate effective optimization in physical design.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Applications of machine learning (ML) techniques to design problems has seen a lot of excitement and promise at lower levels of abstraction. By contrast, corresponding ML approaches for system modeling, design and optimization at higher levels of abstraction have been relatively less explored. In this talk, we will discuss potential solutions, limitations and pitfalls for ML-based system-level design. We will specifically discuss unique challenges and opportunities when applying ML to design problems at higher abstraction levels to close the system-level gap. This will include approaches for predictive modeling and learning-based co-design both vertically across the compute stack as well as horizontally across heterogeneous target components. Time permitting, we will further discuss applications of such ML-based approaches to system architecture exploration, programming and proactive runtime resource management.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Designing a central processing unit (CPU), the brain of a computer, requires intensive manual work of talented experts to implement the circuit logic from design specifications. To relieve human efforts and thus boost the design process, considerable progress has recently been made in electronic design automation and artificial intelligence (AI). However, existing approaches still require hand-crafted formal program code as the input to generate circuit logic. Here we report a RISC-V CPU automatically designed by a new AI approach without a formal blueprint. This approach generates the circuit logic, which is represented by a graph structure called Binary Speculation Diagram (BSD), of the CPU design with almost 100% validation accuracy, only from input-output examples. By efficiently exploring a search space of unprecedented size 10^10^540, our approach generates an industrial-scale RISC-V CPU within only 5 hours. The taped-out CPU successfully runs the Linux operating system and performs comparably against the human-designed Intel 80486SX CPU.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Designing neural network accelerators requires significant engineering effort, and as the rapidly evolving field of machine learning develops new models, the current approach of designing ad hoc accelerators does not scale. In this talk, we will present our on-going work on a high-level synthesis (HLS)-based framework for design space exploration and generation of neural network accelerators. Given architectural parameters, such as datatype, scaling granularity, compute parallelization and buffer sizes, our framework generates a performant tape-out-ready RTL accelerator. Accelerators generated through this framework have been taped out in several chips, targeting various workloads including CNNs, Transformers, and extended reality applications.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Abstract</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Hardware description language (HDL) code designing is a critical component of the chip design process, requiring substantial engineering and time resources. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as GPTs, have demonstrated their potential for automate this intricate task. Nevertheless, the existing LLM-based approaches to HDL code generation do not yet meet the complex requirements of real-world hardware design. Although modern LLMs can process long sequences of context tokens, they often do not produce correspondingly long stretches of code; furthermore, their effectiveness in generating HDL code is still restricted. We propose the AutoSilicon framework, which aims to scale up the hardware design capability of LLMs. AutoSilicon incorporates an agent system, which 1) allows for the decomposition of large-scale, complex code design tasks into smaller, simpler tasks; 2) provides a compilation and simulation environment that enables LLMs to compile and test each piece of code it generates; and 3) introduces a series of optimization strategies. Experimental results show that AutoSilicon could scale the hardware design capability well LLMs in terms of both the design size and quality. To further promote the LLM-based hardware design methodology, we organized the 1st OpenDACs LLM-based Processor Design Competition using the AutoSilicon framework. The outcomes provided a set of lessons learned of LLM-based hardware design methodologies.</p>
