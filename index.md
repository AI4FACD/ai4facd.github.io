Over the past decades, numerous of researchers and engineers have made significant contributions
 to the design of high-performance computers. The pursuit of automated processor design has been 
a long-standing goal. As artificial intelligence (Al) demonstrates its potential to outperform 
humans in specific areas-such as playing Go, optimizing code, and predicting protein 
structures-architecture researchers are increasingly interested in exploring the use of Al techniques
to enable automated processor design. Some recent advancements in this field have made some progress to
Al-based architecture optimization. However, these initiatives lag significantly behind the goal of 
achieving autonomous processor design and self-evolution, a concept envisionedby Von Neumann in 1956 as
"Self-Reproducing Automata". Clearly, processor design is fundamentally diferent from traditional Al
tasks: The precision necessary for CPU designis extraordinarily high(>99.99999999999%), vastly
surpassing the levels typically associated with prediction and generation tasks in the field of Al.
CPU design is the ultimate product of logical computation, an area in which current data-driven Al
technologies fall short, presenting a formidable challenge to the proficiency of modern Al. 
Therefore, we aim to organize this workshop to bring together more architectural designers to discuss
how to apply Al techniques to boost automated architectural design, and where are the boundaries of
Al techniques in automated design. We aim tonecessitate a collaborative effort among researchers
 with expertise in machine learning, programming languages, compilers, computer architecture,
and electronic design automation(EDA).
