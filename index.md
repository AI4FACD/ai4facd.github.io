Welcome to the workshop on "AI for Fully-Automated Chip Design", to be located with ISCA 2024.
Over the past decades, numerous researchers and engineers have made significant contributions
to the design of high-performance computers. The pursuit of automated processor design has been
a long-standing goal. As artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrates its potential to outperform
humans in specific areas — such as playing Go, optimizing code, and predicting protein
structures — architecture researchers are increasingly interested in exploring the use of AI
techniques to enable automated processor design. Some recent advancements in this field have
made some progress in AI-based architecture optimization. However, these initiatives lag
significantly behind the goal of achieving autonomous processor design and self-evolution,
a concept envisioned by Von Neumann in 1956 as "Self-Reproducing Automata". Clearly, processor
design is fundamentally different from traditional AI tasks: The precision necessary for CPU
design is extraordinarily high (>99.99999999999%), vastly surpassing the levels typically
associated with prediction and generation tasks in the field of AI. CPU design is the ultimate
product of logical computation, an area in which current data-driven AI technologies fall short,
presenting a formidable challenge to the proficiency of modern AI.


Therefore, we aim to organize this workshop to bring together more architectural designers to
discuss how to apply AI techniques to boost automated architectural design, and where are the
boundaries of AI techniques in automated design.

This workshop will focus on but not limited to the following topics:
1. High-performance automated design for domain-specific accelerators.
2. Development of Architecture Design Language (ADL) tailored for automated processor design.
3. Utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated circuit design.
4. Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) methodologies.
5. Verification and testing strategies for automated processor design.
6. Design space definition and exploration to improve automated design quality.
7. Emerging methods for automated processor generation.

There will be a mix of invited talks and presentations selected from the submissions to the call
for participation available here. We will have a panel “AI for Fully-Automated Chip Design: Gimmick
or Trend?” after the talks.
