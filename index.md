## About

Over the past decades, numerous of researchers and engineers have made significant contributions to the
design of high-performance computers. The pursuit of **automated processor design** has been a
long-standing goal. As artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrates its potential to outperform humans in
specific areas — such as playing Go, optimizing code, and predicting protein structures — architecture
researchers are increasingly interested in exploring the use of AI techniques to enable automated
processor design.

Some recent advancements in this field have made some progress to AI-based architecture optimization.
However, these initiatives lag significantly behind the goal of achieving autonomous processor design
and self-evolution, a concept envisioned by Von Neumann in 1956 as "Self-Reproducing Automata".

Clearly, processor design is fundamentally diferent from traditional AI tasks: The precision necessary
for CPU designis extraordinarily high(>99.99999999999%), vastly surpassing the levels typically associated
with prediction and generation tasks in the field of AI. CPU design  is the ultimate product of logical
computation, an area in which current data-driven AI technologies fall short, presenting a formidable
challenge to the proficiency of modern AI.

Therefore, we aim to organize this workshop to bring together more architectural designers to discuss
how to apply AI techniques to **boost automated architectural design**, and where are the **boundaries
of AI techniques in automated design**. We aim to necessitate a collaborative effort among researchers
with expertise in **machine learning, programming languages, compilers, computer architecture, and
electronic design automation(EDA)**.


## Topics

This workshop will focus on but not limited to the following topics:
1. High-performance automated design for domain-specific accelerators.
2. Development of Architecture Design Language (ADL) tailored for automated processor design.
3. Utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated circuit design.
4. Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) methodologies.
5. Verification and testing strategies for automated processor design.
6. Design space definition and exploration to improve automated design quality.
7. Emerging methods for automated processor generation.
8. Toolchains for reconfigurable architecture.
